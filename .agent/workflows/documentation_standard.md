# Documentation Workflow

Follow these steps when the user asks you to write or update documentation.

1.  **Identify the Scope**: Determine if the request is for code comments, README updates, or Architecture docs.
2.  **Style Guide**:
    -   Use concise, professional language.
    -   Use Mermaid diagrams for flows.
    -   Use GitHub-flavored markdown.
3.  **Update AGENTS_readme.md**:
    -   If the architecture changes, update the "Directory Structure" and "Components" sections.
4.  **Update Walkthrough**:
    -   If completing a task, update `walkthrough.md` with the latest changes and verification steps.
